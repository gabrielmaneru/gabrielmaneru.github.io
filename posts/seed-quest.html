            <b>Overview:</b>
            Seed Quest is the first 3D game project and 3D engine I worked on during my junior year at Digipen. This was the moment to put in common all the knowledge we gathered to engineer a powerful 3D engine and make a game out of it. We were 13 programmers which resulted in a very challenging coordination and motivation. The game project was ultimately abandoned after the semester, however, the technologies we managed to built were amazing.

            <b>3D Rigid Body Simulation</b>
        </p>
        <p class="main-par">
            I programmed a physics system allowing for primitive collision detection and resolution. I implemented a simple rigid body behavior using Euler integration. To create more complex shapes, I allowed for hierarchical primitives as well as a bounding volume hierarchy for speeding up the broad phase.

            <b>Dungeon Generator</b>
        </p>
        <p class="main-par">
            In the middle of the production, we needed to refactor the game & level design. We previously used large continuous levels that were difficult to create and maintain. Also, any iteration of these levels resulted in several conflicts while merging.
            My objective was to create a level pipeline that would allow us to create & iterate fast the levels and rebuild them with deterministic designs. We moved from the open world to closed rectangular rooms.
        </p>
        <p class="main-par">
            I created a tool that given a tile-map it designs the floor using choosing between floor models, colors and tile properties (such as water, mud or ice). Then I created the environment procedurally by placing props according to some room properties adding a high detail to the scenes. Finally, the resulting props were baked into a single mesh optimizing a lot of its performance. In the end, this tool resulted essential for the game and helped us move from two basic levels into four of them, each having 10-20 connected rooms.

            <b>Dungeon Editor</b>
        </p>
        <p class="main-par">
            To support my previous work which was executed on my own. I needed to create a highly interactable UI that helps my teamwork use my tool and execute their designs. Ìt was divided into two-part, I implemented first a custom in-game tile editor that stored the level blueprints as sprites. Those were easy to merge and share; they also were the main input to the dungeon generator. Then, I implemented a biome UI for designing and coloring the environment.
